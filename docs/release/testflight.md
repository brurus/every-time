# TestFlight external testing

App Store Connect → TestFlight → External Testing → **+** group → add the build. First build of a version goes through Beta App Review (~1 day).

## Test Information

Beta App Description (≤4000):

```
Every Time is a set of time tools in one app: world-clock planner, sleep cycles and nap alarm, a day log, jet-lag planner, Chinese lunar calendar, countdowns, a labor contraction timer, and a drawer of timers and developer time tools.

No account. For sample data on every screen: More tab → Demo mode (a separate store; your own data untouched; it does not read Health).

What's in this beta:
• World: time-zone planner with shared hour strips and working-hour overlap
• Sleep: cycle and nap planner, an alarm that rings in silent mode, sleep log and score (optional read-only import from Health)
• Activities: a day log on a drag-through timeline
• Feeling: tap how you feel through the day
• Jet lag planner
• Chinese lunar calendar with converter and events
• Countdowns, important events, "On this day" (from Wikipedia)
• Labor: contraction timer that reads the pattern against the hospital's "when to call" rule, with a one-tap call button (timing aid only, not a medical device)
• Stopwatch, interview / rehearsal / LeetCode / work timers, Unix timestamp and cron tools
• Widgets: world clock and next countdown

Review Notes (Beta App Review Information):

```
No account or login. For sample data on every screen: More tab → Demo mode. HealthKit is read-only Sleep Analysis, requested only from Sleep → "Add nights from Health". Background audio is used solely so the nap alarm can ring at the set time while the phone is locked (iOS 18-25; iOS 26+ uses AlarmKit).

Labor (More tab → Labor) is a contraction timer, not a medical device and not a diagnosis. It times contractions and compares them with the "when to call" rule the user's care team gave, or a published default (5-1-1; INSPQ/NHS/ACOG). Its "Why" note says the care team's advice comes first, lists warning signs to call about at any time, and cites its sources (Cleveland Clinic, NHS, ACOG, WHO, CDC). It never contacts anyone by itself: the call button opens the phone dialer with the number the user typed. All labor data stays on the device.
```

## Per build: What to Test

```
Turn on More → Demo mode and walk every tab. Then with demo off: add two cities in World and read the overlap; set a nap alarm for 2 minutes, lock the phone with the mute switch on, and confirm it rings; log something in Activities; in More → Labor, tap "Later" on setup and time two contractions; add a countdown and put the widget on your Home Screen. Report anything wrong, especially an alarm that didn't ring, with a screenshot via TestFlight.
